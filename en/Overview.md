The monitoring system is a scaled system on the back of Ceilometer of OpenStack.  
As information on resource use of instances created by a user comes from Hypervisor, there is no need to install a monitoring program. To check monitoring items with specific purposes (e.g. whether server has been down), a monitoring agent is required at a server.
